## ‚ùóÔ∏èExecuting the code locally

### Executing the back-end

You need to have Java and Maven installed and configured locally.

Open the `crud-spring` project in your favorite IDE as a Maven project and execute it as Spring Boot application.

### Executing the front-end

You need to have Node.js 16+ LTS/ NPM installed locally.

1. Install all the required dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

2. Execute the project mode development:

```
yarn dev
```

3. Execute the project mode production:
   
```
yarn prod
```

This command will run the React project with a proxy to the Java server, without requiring CORS.

Open your browser and access **http://localhost:3000** (React default port).
